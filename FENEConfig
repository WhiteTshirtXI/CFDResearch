### Time parameters ###
# deltaT = 0.1
# finaltime = 4
# savetime = 1

### Physical space parameters ###
# Number of grid points in the x and y directions in physical space. Default 512.
n = 64

### Configuration space parameters ###
# Grid spacing in the configuration space.
deltaQ = 0.01
# Number of grid points in the configuration space. If both deltaQ and nQ
# are set then nQ will take precedence. If neither are set, then default is nQ = 32.
nQ = 30
# Fraction of deltaQ by which to offset the grid. Default 0.5.
# offset = .5

### Macroscale parameters ###
# wi = 0.1
# nu = 0.0
# beta = 0.5

### FENE Parameters ###

# Set mode for FENE parameters. Currently valid choices are 'free',
# and 'du'. 'larson' is also below, but not fully implemented yet.
# These modes all just correspond to different
# forms of the Fokker-Planck equation given in different sources.
# Each is described below. The default is 'free'.

FENEMode = free

## 'free' mode parameters

H_free = 1.0				# Spring stiffness
D_free = 1.0				# Diffusion constant
Q0_free = 1.0				# Maximum extensibility
lambda_free = 1.0			# Polymer density

## 'larson' mode parameters
# Choosing this will set the spring stiffness to
#		(2*k_B*T/zeta)*(3/(Q0^2))
# and set the diffusion coefficient to
#		2*k_B*T/zeta,
# which are the constants we get from the expressions on pages
# 142-143 of 'The Structure and Rheology of Complex Fluids'
# by Larson.

zeta_larson = 1.0			# Bead drag
T_larson = 25.0				# Temperature
Q0_larson = 1.0				# Maximum extensibility
lambda_larson = 2.0			# Polymer density

## 'du' mode parameters
# Choosing this will set the spring stiffness to
#		H*2/zeta
# and set the diffusion coefficient to
#		2*k_B*T/zeta,
# which are the constants we get from the expressions in
# Du et. al: 'Fene dumbbell model and its several linear
# and nonlinear closure approximations.'
# The polymeric stress contribution is
#		lambda*\int F(Q) \otimes Q dQ

H_du = 1.0					# Spring stiffness
zeta_du = 1.0				# Bead drag
T_du = 25.0					# Temperature
Q0_du = 1.0					# Maximum extensibility
lambda_du = 2.0				# Polymer density

# Boltzmann's constant
# Default is SI units, can be set to other units by adding a line below.
# kB = 1.3806488e-23			# J/K (SI)
